<p>Hi there! I am Omar Irfan Khan and I am a computer science masters graduate student based in Guelph, Ontario.</p>

<p>I have recently completed my studies at University of Guelph where I designed various artificial intelligence projects ranging in computer vision, machine learning and image processing. During my masters, my <a href="https://github.com/omarirfa/Hybrid-Unsupervised-Classification-Technique-for-Automatic-Brain-MRI-Tumor-Recognition" style="color:blue">thesis</a> was on automatic brain tumor detection where I designed an algorithm to take MRI images and identify where the tumor is and its size. Apart from the projects, my hobbies include playing table tennis and volunteering.</p>




<h1>What I can do</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Analyze and visualize real world data to distinguish anomalies. </li>
  <li>Design and deploy machine learning models in cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure and AWS.</li>
  <li>Build prototypes on hardware models like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li>Manage big data pipelines and data warehouse technologies for multiple use cases.</li>
</ul>
