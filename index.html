<p>Hi there! I am Omar Irfan Khan and I am a computer science masters graduate student based in Guelph, Ontario.</p>

<p>I have recently completed my studies at University of Guelph where I designed various artificial intelligence projects ranging in computer vision, machine learning and image processing. During my masters, my thesis was on automatic brain tumor detection where I designed an algorithm to take MRI images and identify where the tumor is and its size. Apart from the projects, my hobbies include playing table tennis and volunteering.</p>




<h1>What I can do:</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Analyze and visualize real world data to distinguish anomalies. </li>
  <li>Design and deploy machine learning models in cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure and AWS.</li>
  <li>Prototype hardware based models like Arduino or Raspberry pi.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate text classification.</li>
</ul>
