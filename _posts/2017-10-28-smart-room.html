<p>Smart rooms have been proposed in various ways. This was a simplistic approach that I tried to model using an arduino, humidity,temperature sensors and a wifi module. Based on the conditions, if the temperature or humidity increased, the corresponding LEDs would either light up or turn off. A message is relayed in the console about what happened. </p>
