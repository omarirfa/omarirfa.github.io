<p> This was my capstone or senior design project which I worked on during my bachelors. This project had several aims:
 
 <ul>
  <li>To provide a safe area for individuals to perform experiments</li>
  <li>Majors like petroleum engineering are only available in select regions of United Arab Emirates. The main reason for this was due to the lack of accessible laboratory equipment.</li>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
</ul> 

</p>
