<p>Sentimental AI or Senti AI is an android application where users can track how their day went. The unique aspect about this application is that it tries to classify emotions based on what was written via an emoji. A sad emoji indicates a sad entry while, a happy emoji indicates a happy review. More reviews need to be added.</p>
