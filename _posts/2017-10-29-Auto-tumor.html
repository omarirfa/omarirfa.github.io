<p>Brain tumor identification is a very tricky process which is usually done by invasive procedures such as a biopsy or via a blood test. With the boom in MRI imaging, doctors rely on manual interpretations from radiologists to accurately identify the tumor. There have been several softwares such as ITK SNAP or 3D slicer proposed to help radiologists identify tumors faster and more accurately. However, current manual approaches are still slow as compared to automatic brain tumor detection methods.</p>
